00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mike looked up from his screen.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sure, what's up?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Jane said curiously, You've been working here for so long,

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
why haven't you ever taken a break or quit? Mike paused, looked down for a second,

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
then replied quietly, Because I'm afraid that whether I'm here or not, it wouldn't make a
