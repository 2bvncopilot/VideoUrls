00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can't carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Decide what is yours to hold. Let the rest go.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful, simple joys.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You get to pick what your life has time and live for.
