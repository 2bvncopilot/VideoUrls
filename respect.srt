00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I once walked into a cafe with a bearish-degrited every customer with a smile, even the ones who didn't smile back.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
An old man dropped his change, and a teenager nearby helped him pick it up without being asked.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A woman held the door for a mother juggling a stroller and three bags.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
None of them knew each other, but respect was flowing like quiet magic.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That day, I realized respect isn't just about grand gestures.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's in the small, unseen things.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's in listening without interrupting, even if you disagree.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's in thanking the janitor as much as the CEO.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's in not laughing when someone mispronounces a word, because it means they learned it by reading.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The more I gave respect, the more it circled back.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even on bad days, I tried to remember that Everion's carrying something I can't see.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And when I treated others with dignity, I felt lighter, too.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Respect, I learned, doesn't cost a thing, but it changes everything.
