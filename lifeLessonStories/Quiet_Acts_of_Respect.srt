I once walked into a cafe with a barista who greeted every customer with a smile, even

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,760
the ones who didn't smile back.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,400
An old man dropped his change, and a teenager nearby helped him pick it up without being

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,560
asked.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,960
A woman held the door for a mother juggling a stroller and three bags.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,960
None of them knew each other, but respect was flowing like quiet magic.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,680
That day, I realized respect isn't just about grand gestures.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,960
It's in the small unseen things.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,960
It's in listening without interrupting, even if you disagree.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,560
It's in thanking the janitor as much as the CEO.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,760
It's in not laughing when someone mispronounces a word, because it means they learned it

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
by reading.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
The more I gave respect, the more it circled back.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
Even on bad days, I tried to remember that everyone's carrying something I can't see.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
And when I treated others with dignity, I felt lighter too.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,960
But I learned it doesn't cost a thing, but it changes everything.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,280
Thank you.
