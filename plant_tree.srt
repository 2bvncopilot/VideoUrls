00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Two young friends, Min and Hai, each received a seed from their teacher.

2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:10,252
[SPEAKER_00]: The teacher said, whoever grows the most beautiful plant in six months will receive a great reward.

3
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:17,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Min cared for his seed daily, watering it, adding fertilizer, and placing it in the sunlight.

4
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:20,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Hai, however, tucked his seed into a drawer and did nothing.

5
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:25,720
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought, I'll just buy a beautiful plant from the market, why bother growing it?

6
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:30,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months later, Min brought a vibrant, blooming plant with lush leaves.

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Hai presented an expensive purchased plant, its roots still caked with nursery soil.

8
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,843
[SPEAKER_00]: The teacher pointed to Min's plant and said, the reward is yours.

9
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Life does not value deceit.

10
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:46,923
[SPEAKER_00]: True happiness grows from sincere effort, just like the seed you nurtured.

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Lasting success comes from patience and honesty.

12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:56,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seek shortcuts, what you gain through deception, life will take away in other ways.
